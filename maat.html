    <!-- Section 1: Who Ma’at Is -->
    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>Who is Ma’at?</h2>
      <p>
        Ma’at is the embodiment of cosmic truth, balance, reciprocity, harmony,
        right action, and divine law. She governs how energy moves, how justice
        unfolds, and how creation restores itself. Her feather weighs every heart,
        revealing whether one lives in truth or distortion.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To walk with Ma’at is to walk in alignment — where your words, choices, and
        intentions match the truth of your soul.
      </p>

    <section class="text-block">
      <h2>The Purpose of the School of Ma’at</h2>
      <p>
        The School of Ma’at is the heart center of the Temple of Royal Sovereignty.
        It is a sacred learning chamber where initiates remember the original laws
        that govern the heavens, the earth, and the Self.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a traditional school — it is a spiritual order, a remembrance
        chamber, and an activation portal. Here, members return to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Truth — the First Law</li>
        <li>Balance — the sacred middle path</li>
        <li>Order — the natural flow of creation</li>
        <li>Reciprocity — divine exchange</li>
        <li>Harmony — living without inner conflict</li>
        <li>Right Action — moving with integrity and clarity</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
