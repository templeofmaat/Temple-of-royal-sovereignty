      <!-- WHO MA’AT IS -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>Who Ma’at Is</h2>
        <p>
          Ma’at is Living Truth. Not an idea, not a rulebook, not a list of laws — a living field
          of balance, rightness, and clear seeing that holds creation in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever there is alignment between heart, word, action, and purpose, Ma’at is present.
          Wherever there is distortion, confusion, or imbalance, Ma’at reveals it and calls it
          back into order.
        </p>
        <p>
          To walk with Ma’at is to allow Truth to sit in the center of your life:  
          truth in how you treat your body, truth in how you handle resources,  
          truth in how you love, lead, speak, and move.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- MA’AT AS A FIELD, NOT “RULES” -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>Ma’at is a Field, Not a List</h2>
        <p>
          Many speak of Ma’at as if She is a list of “principles” to memorize.  
          In this Temple, Ma’at is understood as a field of order that you step into and live from.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this field:
        </p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>Your heart and your actions match.</li>
          <li>Your inner voice and your outer life speak the same story.</li>
          <li>Your decisions respect your body, your ancestors, and your destiny.</li>
          <li>Your exchanges are honest, clean, and balanced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you move out of that field, your body feels it, your spirit feels it,  
          your life begins to wobble. Ma’at is the call back to center.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>Purpose of the School of Sacred Order</h2>
        <p>
          The Temple of Ma’at: School of Sacred Order is the heart chamber of the Temple
          of Royal Sovereignty. It exists to restore your life to an order that matches
          your soul — not the world’s expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This School is where you learn to:
        </p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>Stand in Truth when it costs you comfort.</li>
          <li>Set boundaries that honor your energy and destiny.</li>
          <li>Release agreements that were made in fear, guilt, or confusion.</li>
          <li>Rebuild your life on foundations that will not collapse under pressure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sacred Order is not control — it is alignment.  
          When you are aligned, your yes is clean, your no is clear, and your path is firm.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- WHAT YOU LEARN HERE -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>What You Learn Inside This Temple</h2>
        <p>
          Inside the School of Sacred Order, you are not asked to “be perfect.”  
          You are invited to become honest, disciplined, and aligned.
        </p>
        <p>You will explore:</p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li><strong>Truth in the Body</strong> — how your body tells you when you are in or out of Ma’at.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth in Relationships</strong> — how to stop abandoning yourself to belong.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth in Resources</strong> — how you receive, give, and hold what comes through your hands.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth in Assignment</strong> — what you are actually here to do, and what you are not.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The work is simple: bring every part of your life into conversation with Truth,  
          and allow what is false to fall away.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- WHO THIS SCHOOL IS FOR -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>Who This School is For</h2>
        <p>
          This chamber is for those who feel a pull to ancient order and inner justice —  
          the ones who are tired of pretending, tired of carrying lies in their body,  
          and ready to live clean.
        </p>
        <p>It is especially for those who:</p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>Carry ancestral memory tied to Kemet and original spiritual law.</li>
          <li>Have walked through systems that used fear and control in the name of “faith.”</li>
          <li>Want their money, relationships, work, and spiritual life to match their soul.</li>
          <li>Know they are called to lead, but refuse to lead from distortion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your spirit has been whispering,  
          “I want my life to be clean, aligned, and true,”  
          then you are already standing at the gates of Ma’at.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- HOW MA’AT MOVES THROUGH TORS -->
      <section class="text-block">
        <h2>Ma’at Within the Temple of Royal Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          In the Temple of Royal Sovereignty, Ma’at is not a side teaching —  
          She is the measurement for everything.
        </p>
        <p>Ma’at weighs:</p>
        <ul class="pill-list">
          <li>How you govern your body.</li>
          <li>How you honor your ancestors and descendants.</li>
          <li>How you move through exchange, offerings, and resources.</li>
          <li>How you speak, teach, and sit in authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nothing built in this Temple is allowed to stand if it does not pass through Ma’at.  
          This is how the work stays clean, and how your own path stays protected.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- COMING CURRICULUM CALLOUT -->
      <section class="callout">
        <p><strong>Curriculum of the School of Sacred Order</strong></p>
        <p>
          The formal teachings, sessions, and scrolls of the School of Sacred Order  
          will be opened in phases. As they unlock, this chamber will become your portal  
          to structured lessons, live gatherings, and written works dedicated to Ma’at.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          For now, let this page serve as a mirror.  
          Ask yourself: <em>“Where in my life is Ma’at already strong — and where is She calling me higher?”</em>
