      <h2>Walk in Balance</h2>
      <p>
        Within the Temple of Ma’at, truth becomes breath and balance becomes being.  
        Here we study the sacred laws that keep heaven and earth aligned.  
        May every word and action weigh light as a feather.

      <h3>The Principle of Ma’at</h3>
      <p>
        Ma’at is the embodiment of cosmic truth, balance, and reciprocity.  
        She governs how energy should move — the divine law aligning heaven, earth, and self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symbolized by the feather, she weighs the heart against truth and keeps creation in harmony.  
        To live by Ma’at is to walk in truth and rightness of heart.

      <h3>Ma’at and the Law of Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Ma’at defines the ethics and balance that determine how energy and currency circulate.  
        Every exchange — spiritual, emotional, or material — must remain in divine reciprocity.  
        In this temple, Ma’at acts as the sacred ledger of divine order,  
        recording whether each flow is balanced or distorted.
