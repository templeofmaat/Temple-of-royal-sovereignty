      <h2>Welcome to the Temple of Royal Sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        This is not merely a website—it is a living temple of remembrance.
Through Ma’at we align with truth and balance; through solar fire and ancestral will, we awaken our sovereign nature and return to divine order.
Here, every breath is sacred order in motion.
