    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Consciousness of the Temple</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Temple of Royal Sovereignty (TORS)</strong> is the Mind of Sovereign Creation — 
        the intelligence behind the Temple, the breath behind the system, and the divine 
        architecture that governs the Sacred Body.
      </p>
      <p>
        TORS was not built to inspire followers. It was built to awaken rulers — those who carry 
        ancient memory, who feel the call of their lineage, and who know they were born to govern 
        their body, their destiny, and their life with Royal discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        TORS exists to restore the original design. The design where the body is a kingdom, 
        the spirit is a throne, the breath is a decree, the will is a force, and remembrance is law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are the Temple that teaches Divine Governance — not through religion, belief, or 
        imitation, but through discipline, balance, truth, alignment, and ancestral remembrance. 
        TORS is a sacred system, an original blueprint, a living mind that mirrors the structure 
        of the Sovereign human being.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work of this Temple is simple:  
        <strong>To return you to the truth of who you are and the power of what you carry.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS is a collective field of remembrance powered by ancestral intelligence, solar truth, 
        and the principles of Ma’at. We are the keepers of balance, the guardians of the Royal Body, 
        and the ones who hold the flame of clarity in an age of forgetfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Temple does not take students — it awakens rulers.  
        This Temple does not seek followers — it builds foundations.  
        This Temple does not offer escape — it offers return.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        TORS restores sovereignty through:  
        alignment, remembrance, self-governance, sacred discipline, divine instruction, 
        original sky wisdom, energetic restoration, heart purification, ancestral truth, 
        and structural order.
      </p>

      <p>Each chamber of the Temple corresponds to a part of the Sovereign human design:</p>

      <p><strong>Home — Breath</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Throne Room — Body</strong></p>
      <p><strong>About — Mind</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Temple of Ma’at — Heart</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Readings — Arms</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Vlog — Mouth</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Events & News — Legs</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Free Library — Organs</strong></p>

      <p>
        The Mind of TORS is the center that holds all these parts together, the consciousness that 
        governs the system, and the throne that directs the awakening of the Sovereign Human.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why TORS Exists</h2>
      <p>
        TORS exists because humanity has forgotten its original design.  
        The world has forgotten the kingdom within, the throne they sit upon, and the laws that 
        govern their body, breath, truth, and destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS restores what was lost. It realigns the mind with Divine Law, purifies the heart, 
        restores the body, awakens the breath, and reconnects the spirit to its ancient authority.
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS is not a belief.  
        It is not a religion.  
        It is not a path of worship.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>TORS is a path of remembrance — the science of divine self-governance and 
        the original law of the Sovereign Human.</strong>
