    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Consciousness of the Temple</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Temple of Royal Sovereignty (TORS)</strong> is the Mind of Sovereign Creation —
        the intelligence behind the Temple, the breath behind the system, and the divine
        architecture that governs the Sacred Body.
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS was not built to inspire followers. It was built to awaken rulers — those who carry
        ancient memory, who feel the call of their lineage, and who know they were born to govern
        their body, their destiny, and their life with Royal discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS exists to restore the original design — where the body is a kingdom, the spirit is a throne,
        the breath is a decree, the will is a force, and remembrance is law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are the Temple that teaches Divine Governance — not through religion, belief, or
        imitation, but through discipline, balance, truth, alignment, and ancestral remembrance.
        TORS is a sacred system, an original blueprint, a living mind that mirrors the structure
        of the Sovereign human being.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work of this Temple is simple:
        <strong>To return you to the truth of who you are and the power of what you carry.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        TORS is a collective field of remembrance powered by ancestral intelligence, solar truth,
        and the principles of Ma’at. We are the keepers of balance, the guardians of the Royal Body,
        and the ones who hold the flame of clarity in an age of forgetfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Temple does not take students — it awakens rulers.<br>
        This Temple does not seek followers — it builds foundations
