  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Consciousness of the Temple</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Temple of Royal Sovereignty (TORS)</strong> is the Mind of Sovereign Creation —
      the intelligence behind the Temple, the breath behind the system, and the divine
      architecture that governs the Sacred Body.
    </p>

    <p>
      TORS was not built to inspire followers. It was built to awaken rulers — those who
      carry ancient memory, who feel the call of their lineage, and who know they were
      born to govern their body, their destiny, and their life with Royal discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      TORS restores the original design — where the body is a kingdom, the spirit is a
      throne, the breath is a decree, the will is a force, and remembrance is law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We teach Divine Governance — not through belief, imitation, or religion, but through
      truth, alignment, discipline, remembrance, and ancestral intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work is simple:
      <strong>Return you to the truth of who you are and the power of what you carry.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      TORS is a collective field powered by ancestral guidance, solar truth,
      and the principles of Ma’at. We are the keepers of balance, guardians of the Royal Body,
      and bearers of clarity in an age of forgetfulness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Temple does not take students — it awakens rulers.<br>
      This Temple does not seek followers — it builds foundations.<br>
      This Temple does not create dependency — it restores sovereignty.
