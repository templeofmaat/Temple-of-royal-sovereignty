    <h2>The Current of Sekhem</h2>
    <p>Sekhem is the divine life-force that animates all creation—the current of power that flows through the aligned heart. It is the energy itself, similar to chi, prana, or kundalini.</p>

    <p>When we live in accordance with Maat, Sekhem moves freely and purely through our being. When Maat is violated, Sekhem becomes blocked or misused. Sekhmet, the lioness aspect of Sekhem, restores balance when truth is broken.</p>

    <h3>Sekhem Flow: The Energy of Exchange</h3>
    <p>Within the Temple of Royal Sovereignty, Sekhem Flow represents the movement of divine energy through our sacred economy. It is the current that fuels creation, sovereignty, and prosperity. Maat governs the why and how; Sekhem expresses the what—the tangible movement of life force through systems, relationships, and creations.</p>

    <p>Aligned with Maat, Sekhem Flow increases exponentially—our energy becomes currency, and our presence becomes wealth.</p>
